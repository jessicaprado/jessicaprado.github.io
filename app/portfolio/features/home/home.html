        <p> Jessica started her programming career back in High School, where she spent her
        time plugging away basic code in her Information Technology in a Global Society (ITGS) course.
        From there, she picked up some computer classes in college, but it wasn't until September of 2016 that
        she finally decided to make it her main focus.

        <p>Jessica graduated from UCF Coding Bootcamp in March 2017 with a comprehensive knowledge of full stack
        development, including, but not limited to Javascript and MEAN Stack.

        <p>Currently Jessica works at Disney, developing code in the Fine Art Photography Department.
